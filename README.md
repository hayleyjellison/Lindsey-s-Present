# Lindsey-s-Present

This is a website with the purpose of helping those with disabilities that prohibit them from completing everyday tasks. I specifically built this for my sister Lindsey, so she can use her Amazon Echo Dot to control the lighting in her room, play music, check the weather, and more. 

The website was created with HTML, using JavaScript to create the functionality of the play, pause, and stop buttons. A bootstrap button was also added to provide a pop-up card with a personalized message for my sister.

SOURCE: github.com/hongkiat provided me with the backbone for this webpage.
