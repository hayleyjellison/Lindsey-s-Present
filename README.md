# Lindsey-s-Present

This is a website with the purpose of helping those with disabilities that prohibit them from completing everyday tasks. I specifically built this for my sister Lindsey, so she can use her Amazon Echo Dot to control the lighting in her room, play music, check the weather, and more. 

SOURCE: github.com/hongkiat provided me with the backbone for this webpage.
